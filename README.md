## 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

---

### 📌 Overview

This project explores a dataset related to student performance to identify factors affecting academic outcomes. Through **exploratory data analysis**, **statistical summaries**, and **visualizations**, we uncover insights about how variables like gender, parental education, test preparation, and study habits influence student scores.

---

### 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical computation
- **Matplotlib** – visualization
- **Seaborn** – statistical plotting
- **sklearn** - data preprocessing
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive development

---

### 🔍 Key Analyses

- Performance comparison by **gender**, **race/ethnicity**, and **parental education level**
- Impact of **test preparation course** on student outcomes
- Correlation between different student habits and scores
- Visual insights using **bar plots**, **histograms**, **boxplots**, and **heatmaps**

### 💡 Insights

- Students who completed the **test preparation course** scored significantly higher.
- **Parental education level** correlates positively with student scores.
- Strong correlation between study time and marks. 

---

### 📈 Future Enhancements

- Build a **predictive model** to forecast student performance.
- Deploy an **interactive dashboard** using Streamlit or Power BI.
- Include data on **attendance**, **sleep**, or **screen time** to deepen the analysis.
